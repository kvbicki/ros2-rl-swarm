# Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms

This project explores the use of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to solve the collision avoidance problem in robot swarms.  
It combines **ROS2 Jazzy**, **Gazebo Harmonic**, and **PyTorch** to build a simulation environment where multiple robots learn navigation strategies.

## Features
- Multi-robot swarm simulation in **Gazebo Harmonic**  
- Robot communication and control via **ROS2 Jazzy**  
- Reinforcement Learning agents implemented in **PyTorch**  
- Training, evaluation, and analysis of collision avoidance strategies
